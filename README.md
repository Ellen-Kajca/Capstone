# Capstone

This notebook contains an analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist from Kaggle. I explore the data, and evaluate different models as well as looking at the most important features.

The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

I begin with data cleaning, and then I explore the data. Specifically, I look at a lot of ditribution. Then, I look at clustering, logistic regression and a decision tree model. 

What factors motivate a consumer to make a purchase, and can we use those factors to identify potential customers?

Expected techniques:
CRISPâ€“DM
Explore data, cluster analysis for classification of customer made purchase or did not, predictive model for predicting target customer, feature importance analysis to see what factors are most important to customers that make a purchase

Expected results:
I expect that there will be a few strong factors that influence the purchasing decision, I also expect that I will be able to target customers who fit the profile of these factors to make purchases
